League Builder 2.0

A program to assist the coach of a youth soccer league. 
The app reads the information from a CSV file. 
It then generates letters to parents informing them what
team their child is on. It also randomly generates the teams
while keeping them even with a 50/50 split of experienced
and inexperienced players.
